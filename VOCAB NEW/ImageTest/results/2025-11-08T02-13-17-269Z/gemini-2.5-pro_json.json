        "reasoning": "**Developing JSON Structure**\n\nI've been working on structuring the JSON output, focusing on `blocks` with `title` and `entries`. This new JSON structure is designed to accurately capture the information from the image and will provide a flexible way to parse the information. I'm focusing on parsing and storing this information in the right object. I'm making progress in making this JSON structure robust.\n\n\n**Crafting the JSON Output**\n\nI'm now implementing the JSON structure, as requested. The core of my current work focuses on parsing the image content into a `blocks` array, where each block will have a title and a corresponding `entries` array. I'm prioritizing accuracy in transcribing numbered items while systematically removing extraneous part-of-speech markers like (n.) and preserving other nuances. My primary goal is to accurately and completely represent all items in JSON. I'm carefully double-checking the character-by-character accuracy. I will move on to the next set of vocabulary when I have completely implemented this, which includes accurately extracting all `idx` and `text` for each item.\n\n\n**Parsing Complex Sections**\n\nCurrently, I'm working to extract and structure the details within more complex sections, like \"14 Steps.\" I've successfully implemented the general parsing for title and entries. My focus now is on correctly handling and structuring items, including the extraction of the `idx` and `text`, even when part-of-speech markers and nuanced formatting are present. I'm taking special care to handle all numbered vocabulary items correctly. I'm diligently ensuring all the details from the image are accurately captured in the JSON output, including maintaining the correct punctuation and wording.\n\n\n**Refining Sectional Accuracy**\n\nI've been meticulously transcribing the \"14 Steps\" section to ensure complete accuracy, especially concerning the items which have varying degrees of complexity. I'm actively implementing the parsing logic to handle instances where part-of-speech markers and contextual formatting are present, and the numbered indices. I'm also now carefully double-checking the character-by-character accuracy, preserving apostrophes, hyphens, and the exact wording including the curly quotes. I am taking care to properly handle any special characters that appear.\n\n\n**Structuring the \"14 Steps\"**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in transcribing the \"14 Steps\" section, ensuring each entry in the JSON accurately reflects the image. I'm taking special care to preserve colons when they appear within vocabulary items, but still correctly removing the part-of-speech markers like `(n.)` or `(v.)`. I'm confident that the current output is accurate and adheres to the specifications. I will start on the next section soon.\n\n\n**Structuring Full Sections**\n\nI've moved on to transcribing the \"Goalkeeper\" section, keeping the colons as part of the text and successfully handling the `idx` and `text` extraction. I'm focusing on ensuring accuracy in handling each section's numbered items. I am currently working on implementing and testing my parsing logic with the \"Hassan\" section.\n\n\n**Transcribing Final Sections**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in transcribing the remaining sections, Unit 13, 14, and 15, ensuring complete accuracy for each `idx` and `text` entry. My focus is on handling commas, periods, and maintaining the original format. I'm taking special care to accurately transcribe all items.\n\n\n**Structuring the Remaining Data**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in transcribing the Unit 13, 14, and 15 sections, diligently handling commas, periods, and maintaining the original formatting. I'm focusing on preserving punctuation like colons, and handling special characters as they appear, like apostrophes. I am confident in the accuracy of my current output, and will soon complete the full JSON structure.\n\n**Finalizing the JSON Output**\n\nI've meticulously reviewed the JSON output, including special characters and punctuation, ensuring complete adherence to specifications. The \"14 Steps\" section, with its nuances, and all other sections are now accurately transcribed. The JSON structure is complete, and the output is ready for submission, reflecting meticulous attention to detail.\n\n\n**Completing Final Checks**\n\nI'm now putting the finishing touches on the JSON output. I'm carefully reviewing the transcription, paying close attention to punctuation, special characters, and any remaining nuances in formatting. I am confident that the final output accurately and comprehensively reflects the image's content. I'm focusing on preserving the integrity of each entry.\n\n\n**Refining JSON Output**\n\nI'm finalizing the JSON structure, paying close attention to formatting and the preservation of all details. I'm focusing on ensuring accuracy in the `idx` and `text` fields, particularly regarding commas and special characters. I'm also now ready to carefully check my final output, ensuring that the entire JSON file complies with the specifications.\n\n\n",

I’ll start counting the entries and transcribing them. The first section, \"Goalkeeper\", has vocabulary from numbers 1 through 15, including terms like \"anthropology\", \"philosophy\", and \"misanthrope\". \n\nI must also ensure to remove colons, strip part-of-speech labels, and adjust apostrophes while expanding any plurals. Finally, I should only transcribe the items without including any headings.**Transcribing the \"Hassan\" section**\n\nNext, I’m moving on to the \"Hassan\" section, which likely has numbers 1 to 13. I’ll transcribe the entries listed under the left column. The vocabulary includes terms like \"hovel\", \"dank\", \"covet\", and others up to \"plummet\". \n\nI need to ensure that I remove any punctuation to create a clean list: hovel, dank, covet, crave, spool, horde, shove, trophy, uncoil, coil, overcast, ragged, plummet. \n\nThen, I’ll carefully transcribe the \"14 Steps\" section, which seems to have numbered items from 1 to 40, starting with phrases about cats.**Transcribing \"14 Steps\" items**\n\nI’m working on the \"14 Steps\" section and I need to ensure I replace any straight apostrophes with the right single quotation mark. The entries I’m looking at include phrases like \"let the cat out of the bag\" and \"put the cat among the pigeons,\" among others.\n\nI have to remove part-of-speech labels like (n.) and expand terms like \"affliction(s)\" to \"afflictions.\" I'll also strip trailing colons for items like \"to a degree:\", and make sure all apostrophes are curly. So, it's about getting everything correctly formatted!**Continuing transcription for \"14 Steps\"**\n\nI’m continuing with the middle column, which has numbers 15 to 28. This includes terms like \"disillusionment,\" \"hold on to,\" and \"lead up to.\" I need to ensure I remove any punctuation and colons. For \"sanity,\" I need to output it directly without the (n.) label. Also, for \"jack up:\", I’ll keep it as \"jack up\" without the colon.\n\nMoving on to the right column 29 to 40, I’ll ensure phrases like \"fumble with/in sth. for sth.\" maintain the format, but I need to remove any spaces around slashes to keep it consistent. It's all about clarity!**Counting vocabulary items for output**\n\nIt looks like there are 21 items in Unit 15, but I need to confirm. The entries include terms like \"beacony,\" \"berserk,\" and \"celestial.\" After reviewing the list, I can confirm there are 20 items in Unit 15. This discrepancy makes me think that I possibly missed a number in the \"Hassan\" section, which I initially thought had 14 entries but actually has only 13.\n\nNow, I want to ensure my total adds up to 129 as requested. It seems I counted entries, and the final output needs to reflect any split items. I'll double-check each section again, ensuring everything adheres to the normalization rules and matches what the instructions specify. Let's put everything into the correct order!**Reviewing and finalizing vocabulary items**\n\nI’m working through the items for \"Hassan\" and \"14 Steps.\" I've noted terms like \"beacon,\" \"shamefaced,\" and others, ensuring to follow the normalization rules, like removing spaces around slashes and expanding any plural forms. \n\nFor the last items, I'm examining the uncertainty around \"beacon\" and \"shamefaced.\" I believe I've settled on using these terms, as they seem to fit the vocabulary list best. \n\nNow, I want to ensure the total reaches exactly 129 items, considering the split items too. I'll carefully compile the words to stay organized and accurate!**Creating JSON for vocabulary list**\n\nI'm continuing with the numbering for the words and now I need to produce a JSON object containing the 129 entries. I’ll ensure that I convert the apostrophe in “cat’s” to a curly quote and check any other apostrophes. \n\nAdditionally, I’ll maintain any slashes without spaces, keep the abbreviation “sb.” intact, and remove POS labels as needed. I’ll double-check that the total count is indeed 129. Once everything is confirmed, I'll prepare the JSON output!",
